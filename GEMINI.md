## General Principles
- Prioritize **clarity and maintainability** over cleverness or brevity.
- Write code that is **self-explanatory** — minimal need for comments to clarify logic.

this project is a react web app that needs to be extremely easy to use - allowing anyone to calculate the amount of money/co2 saved by using solar panels. It works by by either selecting a point on the map and sending the coordinates to an api which calculates the usable roof or selecting an area on the map, and sending the selected polygon to that api which calculates the amount of solar power generated.
